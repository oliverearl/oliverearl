# 👋 Welcome!

Hey, my name's Oliver, but you can call me Ollie, and I'm a full-stack web developer from the UK. Prior to that, I was a postgraduate student studying post-compulsory education and worked as a trainee computer science teacher in a top state school.

## 👨‍🏫 A bit about me

- 🎓 I have just finished my teaching qualification from Birmingham City University, and have obtained both an Master's degree in Software Engineering and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in German from Aberystwyth University.
- 🖥 PHP and JavaScript are the programming languages I'm most passionate about, especially when coupled with Laravel and Vue.js.
- 🕹 I enjoy working on video game development at the weekend, though I'm yet to become good at it!
- 🇩🇪 I did a software engineering internship at Amadeus IT Group near Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany.
- 🌱 My outside interests are broad, but a lot of my free time goes into writing on my [blog](https://blog.oliverearl.co.uk) and volunteering in student welfare.
