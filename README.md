# 👋 Welcome!

Hey, my name's Oliver, but you can call me Ollie. I currently work as a computer science teacher though I'm looking to transition into a career in software engineering.

## 👨‍🏫 A bit about me

- 🎓 I'm finishing my teaching qualification at Birmingham City University, and graduated with my MSc in Software Engineering and BSc in major/minor Computer Science with German from Aberystwyth University.
- 🖥 PHP and JavaScript are the programming languages I'm most interested in, especially the Laravel framework. I mainly use C# and Python in the classroom.
- 🌍 English is my mother tongue and I speak German quite well! I would love to learn another language. 
- 🌱 My interests are broad, but much of my free time outside of programming goes into writing on my [blog](https://blog.oliverearl.co.uk) and volunteering in student welfare.
