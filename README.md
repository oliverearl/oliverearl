# 👋 Welcome!

Hey, my name's Oliver, but you can call me Ollie. I'm a software engineer and qualified teacher of computer science from the UK. I currently work full-time at [@stickeeuk](https://www.github.com/stickeeuk) as a full-stack developer.

## 👨‍💻 Quick facts!
- I work with Laravel (5.8 - 9), Vue.js (2 & 3), Nuxt.js, and Sass to build robust and memorable applications on the web. Inertia.js is my latest guilty pleasure! 

- I'm no stranger to retrofitting legacy applications and know my way around WordPress, CodeIgniter 3, and all the trials and tribulations of working in legacy PHP and jQuery.

- I'm currently studying for the [Zend ZCE-2017 Exam](https://www.zend.com/training/php-certification-exam), with plans to become [Laravel certified](https://certification.laravel.com/) shortly afterwards.

- I speak German quite well after studying it as my minor at university, though it's a little rusty.

- 2022 is going to be the year I get fit - _blog post pending_! <!-- Seriously! I mean it this time! -->

## 💓 ExtraContinue

After I almost passed away in 2021 from vaccine complications, I began work on [@ExtraContinue](https://www.github.com/extracontinue), an app that will help you take care of things should you ever disembark your mortal life prematurely. The beta release will be available in April 2022! 

## 🎮 Petrobolos

[@Petrobolos](https://www.github.com/petrobolos) is an indie game studio founded by myself and some of my talented friends in April 2020 during the initial COVID-19 lockdowns. Projects are currently on hiatus, but more announcements on projects are expected this year, including the Nimbus Game Engine, and Hong Kong 97 Remastered for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## ⏰ Other experience

- Mental health and student welfare are issues close to my heart, and as such I currently volunteer for the [Nightline Association](https://www.nightline.ac.uk) as the elected Regional Coordinator for Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿, supporting and administrating the student-run listening services across the country.

- I formerly taught Computer Science and IT at [Arden Academy](https://www.arden.solihull.sch.uk), one of the top state schools in England. My former students know that I know that they're reading this! 👀

- I formerly interned as a front-end developer at [Amadeus IT Group](https://github.com/amadeusitgroup) in their Bad Homburg office in Germany. 🇩🇪

- I have a Master's degree in software engineering and a Bachelor's in Computer Science (with a minor in German) from [Aberystwyth University](https://www.aber.ac.uk). I qualified as a teacher at [Birmingham City University](https://www.bcu.ac.uk). 🎓
