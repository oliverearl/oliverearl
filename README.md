# 👋 Welcome!

Hey, my name's Oliver, but you can call me Ollie. I'm a software engineer from the UK. I currently work full-time at [@stickeeuk](https://www.github.com/stickeeuk) as a full-stack developer. I'm also a qualified computer science teacher.

You can find out more about me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliverearl), or you can grab my CV below.

## 🎮 Petrobolos

[@Petrobolos](https://www.github.com/petrobolos) is an indie game studio founded by myself and some of my talented friends in April 2020 during the initial COVID-19 lockdowns. Projects are currently on hiatus, but more announcements on projects are expected this year, including the Nimbus Game Engine, and Hong Kong 97 Remastered for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
