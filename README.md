# 👋 Welcome!

Hey, my name's Oliver, but you can call me Ollie, and I'm a full-stack junior developer from the UK. Prior to that, I was a postgraduate student studying post-compulsory education and worked as a trainee computer science secondary school teacher.

## 👨‍🏫 A bit about me

- 🖥 My favourite tech: Laravel, Vue.js, Nuxt, TypeScript, PHP 8
- 🕹 I enjoy working on video game development at the weekend, though I'm yet to become good at it!
- 🇩🇪 I did a software engineering internship at Amadeus IT Group, Germany
- 🌱 I write for my [blog](https://blog.oliverearl.co.uk) and volunteer for the Nightline Association in my free time
